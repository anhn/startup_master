Ask both chatbots the **same initial question**, then let the conversation flow naturally for each chatbot.")

Low- and high-fidelity prototypes can for instance contribute to testing hypotheses about customer needs, and facilitate fundraising and early user engagement. In the early stages, low-fidelity prototypes will help the startup explore their idea and understand if the problem is worth solving. Later on, high-fidelity prototypes can help secure investors and early adopters. This exposure can help drive the startup for further growth and establish a solid market presence.")
