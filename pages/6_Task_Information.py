Test out **all** the chatbots (Chatbot 1, Chatbot 2 and Chatbot 3), then answer the questionnaire. Ask all chatbots the **same initial question**, then let the conversation flow naturally for each chatbot.")

    st.write("Creating an MVP is an important step on the way to understanding customers, and obtaining feedback from stakeholders in early stages. Low- and high-fidelity prototypes can for instance contribute to testing hypotheses about customer needs, and facilitate fundraising and early user engagement. In the early stages, low-fidelity prototypes will help the startup explore their idea and understand if the problem is worth solving. Later on, high-fidelity prototypes can help secure investors and early adopters. This exposure can help drive the startup for further growth and establish a solid market presence.")
